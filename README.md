# Direct Modification of Instance Variables in Ruby

This example demonstrates a common error in Ruby: directly modifying instance variables without using setter methods.  While you can access the instance variable using the getter method, it won't allow modifications unless you define a setter method.

The `bug.rb` file shows the issue, and `bugSolution.rb` demonstrates the correct approach.
